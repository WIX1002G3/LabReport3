Create instance variables for all the attributes with appropriate type, create constructor for all the instance variables and 
create Accessor and Mutator (Getter and Setter) for all the attributes so that its value can be displayed or modified later.

Generate random value for Hit Point (15-25), ATK (10-17), DEF (10-17), SPD (5-15) and SPC (5-10) by using Random() in a new method.

Create another new method to update the attributes when level increases by 1 by using accessor and mutator defined in the class,
use Random() again to random generate a number within given increment range.
