First, we create a class called Doll and assign characteristics as name, hairColor, clothes, hairLength to the class as instance variables. 
Next, we need to initialize values to hair color, clothes, hair length and randomly assign. The doll can have 3 different hair colors(black, pink, brown), 3 different clothes(shirt, dress, jacket), and 2 different hair lengths(long and short).
Next step is to create methods to change the doll's haircolor, and to cut its hair. 
Finally, we can create an another method for displaying all the characteristics, and test out results in the main method by calling methods for displaying, changing hair color, and cutting the hair.
