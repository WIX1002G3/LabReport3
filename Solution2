First, we need create a class called Doll and assign characteristics as name, hairColor, clothes, hairLength to the class as instance variables. 
Next, we need to initialize values to hair color, clothes, hair length and randomly assign using random generator. The doll can have 3 different hair colors(black, pink, brown), 3 different clothes(shirt, dress, jacket), and 2 different hair lengths(long and short).
Next step is to create methods to change the doll's haircolor, and to cut its hair. This can be done by again using random generators between 3 hair colors. For cutting the hair, if the doll's hair is long, assign the hair length to short.
Finally, we can create an another method for displaying all the characteristics, and test out the result in the main method by calling methods for displaying, changing hair color, and cutting the hair.
